Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application.

Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:

Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.
Facilitates Communication:

It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
